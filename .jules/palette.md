## 2024-05-22 - Password Visibility Toggle
**Learning:** Users often struggle with complex password requirements and typing on mobile devices. Providing a "Show Password" toggle significantly reduces login friction and frustration, especially for users with accessibility needs who rely on visual confirmation.
**Action:** Always include a password visibility toggle in authentication forms. Ensure it's accessible via keyboard and screen readers (using `aria-label` and proper button semantics).
