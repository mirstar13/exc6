## 2024-05-23 - Password Visibility Toggle
**Learning:** Adding a password visibility toggle is a high-impact micro-UX improvement. It significantly reduces user frustration (typing errors) and improves accessibility for users with cognitive or motor impairments who may struggle with masked input fields. It requires minimal code but directly addresses a core usability heuristic (User Control and Freedom).
**Action:** Always check authentication forms for password masking and propose a toggle if missing. Ensure the toggle is keyboard accessible and uses ARIA labels.
